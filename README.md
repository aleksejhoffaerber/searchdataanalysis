Goals
-------------------

The aim of this marketing project was to evaluate a clients search engine effectiveness and to build recommendations for future keyword optimization. Despite the attractiveness of Excel for those type of quick analysis, I created an R script that help to clean, analyse, and wrangle marketing data with low effort. 

The result is a very facilitated search engine analysis, which leverages non-statistical techniques, such as Factorial Analyses etc. Furthermore, concerns with the given data and genelral case set-up are discussed in the Appendix of the report.
